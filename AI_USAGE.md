## AI Prompts Used
1. "You can find this file in the folder we are in, please according to this txt file, please generate the project"
2. "ok, so invoices.json is not loading, because the design appears, the server runs. but it is an empty table"
3. "GET /api/invoices?status=&q=&page=1&per_page=10 maybe because of the filters it doesnt load?"
4. "can you modify the file according to your fixes?"
5. "I give you permission to debug it and modify the file inside the folder so it can be fixed"
6. "pls debug this section so i can see where the data is being lost"
7. "how can i directly see the result of this api request?"
8. "http://localhost:8000/api/invoices.php Not Found The requested resource /api/invoices.php was not found on this server."
9. "maybe thats why the api calls doesnt fetch any data, because of the pathing or something? i moved it to public invoices.php and the get works perfectly it retrieves all the data that is needed"
10. "RewriteRule ^api/invoices$ invoices.php GET /api/invoices?status=&q=&page=1&per_page=10 why i still cant reach it?"
11. "it doesnt seem like htaccess is working, maybe i need to restart the server? it is good in apache"
12. "http://localhost/uvatask/uvatask/public/test with this it works but http://localhost:8000/test this doesnt work"
13. "based on this file, add every route that we will be needing from the task.txt"
14. "now create workspace to public invoices.php is the only file i have, so please create all the other ones mentioned in router.php"
15. "can you create files? or you could do it only in the beginning?"
16. "inside public folder, create 
invoices_create.php
invoice_show.php
invoice_pay.php
invoice_update.php
invoice_delete.php

you can see how the uris are looking like, please fill them with the correct code, for creating new json data, updating, deleting etc"
17. "can you please implement the action columns?"
18. "Object { customer: "afssf", amount: "25", currency: "RSD", due_date: "2025-09-11", status: "pending" }

"Error creating invoice""
19. "i see now, i cant create new element because i have an empty json, is this possible? can we fix it?"
20. "i have these actions Show Edit Delete, when i first click on edit, it works, i can edit the invoice, but if i click on show and after the edit, the edit button shows the same thing as the show button, why is this behaviour happening?"
21. "please simplify it, i dont need multiple functions"
22. "we have page, per_page and total data. so you need to implement a pagination style solution"
23. "generate dummy data [ { "id": 1, "customer": "asffs", "amount": "25", "currency": "RSD", "status": "pending", "due_date": "2025-09-04", "updated_at": "2025-09-03T11:58:39Z" }, { "id": 2, "customer": "sgvsg", "amount": "25555", "currency": "RSD", "status": "paid", "due_date": "2025-09-11", "updated_at": "2025-09-03T11:55:00Z" } ] in this form, pls give me 15 other like that, customer should be better than my writings, status can be paid or pending currency rsd only, updated_at must keep this form of date"
24. "its missing mostly, we need to implement this function"
25. "we need to add deleted_at field to every element in json, so change every code according to that"
26. "you heard it king"


## Code Blocks
- Most of the code snippets for API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) and JSON dummy data were generated by AI.
- I reviewed and sometimes edited the generated code to fix paths, adjust parameters, and make sure the API worked with the frontend.
- The dummy JSON dataset was generated fully by AI but double-checked manually for consistency (dates, IDs, currency format).

## Bugs or Hallucinations
- Pathing Issues: The AI initially pointed to /api/invoices.php, but the correct working file had to be placed in the public/ directory. Verified by running API requests manually.
- htaccess Hallucination: The AI generated .htaccess rewrite rules, but they had no effect. After testing, I confirmed this was unnecessary, and the file was deleted.
- Empty JSON Handling: When invoices.json was empty, the AIâ€™s generated code failed to add new entries. This was fixed by adjusting the code to initialize the file properly.

## Self-Review
**AI-assisted parts**:
- Starting off a simple project
- Most backend boilerplate code (router, CRUD endpoints, dummy JSON data)
- Pagination logic and dummy dataset

**My contributions**:
- Debugging file path issues and confirming server behavior
- Manually testing endpoints in the browser and adjusting code accordingly
- Simplifying functions and ensuring only the required routes were implemented
- Verifying and editing AI outputs to prevent errors (especially in file handling and JSON updates)

**Caution for production**:
- I would add stricter input validation and sanitization.
- Error handling needs to be more robust.
- Routing should be tested in a clean Apache environment to avoid hidden server config dependencies.
